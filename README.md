# CORDIC-Verilog-Implementation

Modern digital signal processing (DSP) and communication systems often require efficient computation of trigono-
metric and vector-based functions. The CORDIC algorithm provides a hardware-friendly iterative method that
eliminates the need for multipliers, relying only on shifts and additions. This makes it well-suited for FPGA and
ASIC implementations.
This repository focuses on the design of a 32-bit pipelined CORDIC unit implemented in Verilog HDL
